## Project Overview:

This project applies supervised machine learning to forecast stock price trends from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) dataset. Our project compares performance of machine learning models in forecasting the trend in the price of stocks based on the historical price split adjusted data. By predicting the direction of stock price movement (increase or decrease), our model enables data-driven decision-making for investors, traders, and portfolio managers. 

By leveraging machine learning on historical NYSE price data (adjusted for splits), our model can:

* Identify market trends and momentum patterns faster than manual chart analysis.  
* Support automated trading or portfolio rebalancing strategies with quantitative insights.  
* Demonstrate how modern ML techniques can enhance traditional technical analysis methods.

This project provides a reproducible ML pipeline that can be reproduced by different machine learning engineers and data scientists for varied dataset from different sources.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher (required by core dependencies)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Dependencies

This project relies on a suite of Python libraries and frameworks that support end-to-end data science workflows, including data preprocessing, machine learning, model evaluation, interpretability, and visualization.

### Installation

All libraries, packages and other dependencies that needs to be installed to run your project can be installed using:

1. Clone the repo
    
    `git clone https://github.com/ashwinder1/Stock-Trend-Analysis-with-NYSE.git`

2. Setup (and activate) your environment
    
    `conda env create -f requirements.yml`

## Dataset Overview

We use Prices Split Adjusted dataset that has split adjusted price data of 501 unique companies from S&P index of New York Stock Exchange. Most of data spans from 2010 to the end 2016 and for companies new on stock market date range is shorter.
