    "## Model Summaries\n",
    "The project began with Model 1, a minimal LSTM baseline designed to confirm that sequential stock data could be framed as a binary classification problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mOdel 1 shows a near-random accuracy, we introduced Model 2-A with deeper dense layers and dropout to capture richer nonlinear dependencies among features, while Model 2-B extended training to test convergence and overfitting behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "To move beyond binary labels, in Model 3-A we redefined the target as a continuous “relative-price-up” score to capture the importance of increased values as well, also extending the temporal window to 100 days to capture medium-term momentum; Model 3-B further refined this regression-style approach with tuned hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Model 4-A incorporated symbol embeddings to learn across multiple tickers simultaneously, as the stock behaviors might share latent patterns, and Model 4-B deepened this architecture to enhance representational capacity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Across iterations, the modeling strategy evolved from simple sequence learning to multi-stock representation learning, revealing that while architecture and temporal depth offered modest recall gains, true predictive improvement likely requires feature enrichment (technical indicators, sentiment, or macroeconomic data) and longer-horizon context rather than additional model complexity.\n",

    "## Interpretation: Model Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall trend:\n",
    "All models perform close to random (≈0.50 across metrics), indicating that price movement prediction from past OHLCV data alone remains a highly stochastic problem. None of the architectures achieve strong discriminative power (ROC-AUC ≈ 0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Marginal improvements:\n",
    "Model 3 shows a slight gain in recall (0.58) and F1-score (0.54), suggesting it captured marginally more upward movements, possibly due to its longer temporal context or regression-style target transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 4 underperformance:\n",
    "Despite its complexity and symbol embeddings, Model 4’s recall (0.40) and F1 (0.45) are weaker. This implies that the additional parameters did not generalize well, perhaps due to overfitting or noisy cross-stock correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Takeaway:\n",
    "Architectural depth and embeddings alone don’t overcome the weak predictive signal in short-horizon price data. Future improvement likely requires feature enrichment (technical indicators, sentiment, macro events) and longer context windows (≥ 60–100 days) rather than further model complexity."
